## News Homepage
I designed this responsive news homepage as my response to the News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor. It serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in front-end development and my capability to construct a contemporary web interface.

## My Approach
I constructed the project primarily using HTML5 and CSS3, implementing responsive design principles to ensure its compatibility with various screen dimensions. I leveraged JavaScript to elevate user engagement and functionality.

Key technologies and tools employed:

HTML5: I established the project's foundation and content utilizing semantic HTML tags.

CSS3: Customized CSS styles were applied to craft the desired layout, incorporating responsive design components.

JavaScript: I harnessed JavaScript to introduce interactive elements, notably the mobile navigation menu.

## Execution
The project commenced with my creation of the HTML framework, emphasizing semantic markup to optimize accessibility and search engine performance.

I utilized CSS comprehensively to style the entire page, meticulously addressing details such as typography, color palettes, and responsive design.

JavaScript was seamlessly integrated to deliver the following features:

Mobile Navigation Menu: I implemented a mobile-friendly navigation menu that smoothly opens and closes upon clicking the menu button, ensuring a seamless user experience on smaller screens.
